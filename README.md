# Robinhood MCP Server

A read-only MCP (Model Context Protocol) server wrapping the [robin-stocks](https://github.com/jmfernandes/robin_stocks) (unofficial) Robinhood API.

## Features

- **Read-only access**: Market data, options, portfolio, watchlists, news, and fundamentals
- **Normalized schemas**: Consistent, typed responses with numeric coercion and ISO 8601 timestamps
- **Biometric-friendly auth**: Works with app-based authentication flow (no MFA code needed)
- **Lazy authentication**: Authenticates on first tool call, not at startup
- **Session caching**: Persists sessions to disk via robin-stocks pickle files for faster reconnects

## Quick Start

Add to your OpenCode config (`~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` or project-level `opencode.json`):

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "mcp": {
    "robinhood": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": [
        "uvx",
        "--from", "git+https://github.com/ach968/robin-stocks-mcp.git",
        "robinhood-mcp",
        "--username", "your_robinhood_username",
        "--password", "your_robinhood_password"
      ],
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

This uses [`uvx`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/tools/) to run the server
directly from GitHub without cloning or installing anything manually.

### With session caching

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "mcp": {
    "robinhood": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": [
        "uvx",
        "--from", "git+https://github.com/ach968/robin-stocks-mcp.git",
        "robinhood-mcp",
        "--username", "your_robinhood_username",
        "--password", "your_robinhood_password",
        "--session-path", "/path/to/session/directory"
      ],
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note:** `--session-path` specifies a **directory** where robin-stocks stores its
> `robinhood.pickle` session file, not a file path.

### CLI Arguments

| Arg | Env Fallback | Description |
|-----|-------------|-------------|
| `--username` | `RH_USERNAME` | Robinhood username |
| `--password` | `RH_PASSWORD` | Robinhood password |
| `--session-path` | `RH_SESSION_PATH` | Directory for session pickle file |
| `--allow-mfa` | `RH_ALLOW_MFA=1` | Enable MFA code fallback (off by default) |

CLI args take priority over environment variables. You can also pass credentials
via the `environment` block instead of inline args:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "mcp": {
    "robinhood": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": [
        "uvx",
        "--from", "git+https://github.com/ach968/robin-stocks-mcp.git",
        "robinhood-mcp"
      ],
      "environment": {
        "RH_USERNAME": "your_username",
        "RH_PASSWORD": "your_password"
      },
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Installation (for development)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ach968/robin-stocks-mcp.git
cd robin-stocks-mcp
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Available Tools

### Market Data
- `robinhood.market.current_price` - Get current price quotes for one or more symbols
- `robinhood.market.price_history` - Get historical OHLCV data (intervals: 5min, 10min, hour, day, week)
- `robinhood.market.quote` - Get detailed quotes with previous close and change percent

### Options
- `robinhood.options.chain` - Get options chain for a symbol (calls and puts with greeks)

### Portfolio
- `robinhood.portfolio.summary` - Portfolio equity, cash, buying power, and day change
- `robinhood.portfolio.positions` - Current positions with market value and unrealized P&L

### Watchlists
- `robinhood.watchlists.list` - List all watchlists with their symbols

### News
- `robinhood.news.latest` - Get latest news for a stock symbol (symbol required)

### Fundamentals
- `robinhood.fundamentals.get` - Company fundamentals (market cap, P/E, dividend yield, 52-week range)

### Auth
- `robinhood.auth.status` - Check whether the session is authenticated

## Authentication Flow

1. The server starts without attempting login
2. On first tool call, robin-stocks tries to restore a cached session from the pickle file
3. If the cached session is valid, it is used without any interaction
4. If no valid session exists, it attempts a fresh login with credentials
5. If Robinhood requires a challenge and MFA is disabled, it returns an `AUTH_REQUIRED` error
6. To resolve: approve the login in the Robinhood app, then retry the tool call

## Testing

Unit tests:
```bash
pytest tests/unit -v
```

Integration tests (requires credentials):
```bash
RH_INTEGRATION=1 pytest tests/integration -v
```

## Security Notes

- This server is **read-only** and cannot place orders or modify your account
- Credentials are passed via CLI args or environment variables
- Session tokens are cached as pickle files (optional, user-controlled path)
- Passwords and tokens are never logged
